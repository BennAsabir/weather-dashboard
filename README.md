## General Info
When a user searches for a city, the user is presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history. 
When looking at the weather conditions for a certain city, the user will be presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index (which will display if the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe).
